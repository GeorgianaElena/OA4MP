<h1>Dynamic Client Registration</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">dynamic client registration</a>
    specification
    is supported in OA4MP as of version 4.2. This means that a trusted administrative client can dynamically
    create regular clients for use with an OA4MP system. If you have not done so already, you should
    read the section on
    <a href="administrative-clients.html">administrative clients </a>.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When we refer to a client we mean an OAuth 2 client and otherwise any other will be qualified such
    as "admin client".</p>

<h2>How's it work?</h2>
<p>
    If you are not an administrator and just need a client,  you should go
    to <code>../oauth2/register</code>. Your request will then be seen by the site adminstrator(s)
    and once approved, you will be notified. The facilities described in this document allow
    for a trusted (after vetting, of course) site manager who
    must manage several OAuth clients to do so without having to resort to the usual vetting process.
</p>
<h3>How to become an admin</h3>
<p>You must register an administrative client as per <a href="administrative-clients.xhtml">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Implemented specifications here.</h3>

<p>The two specifications that are behind this are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>
    and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592">RFC 7592</a>. The flow is that you register an
    administrative client. This is initially not approved and any operation you try will fail
    with a message to that effect. We get an notification and once the admin client is approved,
    it may be used. All calls then create regular (not admin!) clients for use with OA4MP.
     </p>

<p>The RFCs specify a REST-ful API for clients, so that</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>POST</b> creates a new client</li>
    <li><b>GET</b> lists what the server knows about this client</li>
    <li><b>PUT</b> will update the client</li>
    <li><b>DELETE</b> will remove the client and all of its information from the server</li>
</ul>

<h3>The toolkit</h3>
<p>Included with the latest release on <a href="https://github.com/ncsa/OA4MP">GitHub</a>
    are a suite of associated command line scripts in oidc-cm-scripts.tar aka the <b><i>toolkit</i></b>
    which contains a complete but minimal functional toolkit. There are basic scripts for each
    method as well as several examples for using each.</p>

<p>To dynamically register a client you need to make a call to the supported service
    endpoint, typically <code>../oauth2/oidc-cm</code> with the appropriate HTTP method
    and payload. The specification should not be repeated here but the toolkit has a tutorial
    and many examples. There is also a very detailed <a href="https://github.com/ncsa/OA4MP/blob/master/oa4mp-server-admin-oauth2/src/main/scripts/oidc-cm-scripts/readme.txt">readme.txt</a> in the toolkit</p>
