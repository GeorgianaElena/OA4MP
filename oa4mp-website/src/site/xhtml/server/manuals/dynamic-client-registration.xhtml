<h1>Dynamic Client Registration</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">dynamic client registration</a>
    specification
    is supported in OA4MP as of version 4.2. This means that a trusted administrative client can dynamically
    create regular clients for use with an OA4MP system. If you have not done so already, you should
    read the section on
    <a href="administrative-clients.html">administrative clients </a>.
</p>

<h2>How's it work?</h2>
<p>
    We do not support registrations for a simple client to this endpoint. For that you should go
    to <code>../oauth2/register</code>. Your request will then be seen by the adminstrator(s)
    and once approved, you will be notified. This facility is to allow for a site manager who
    must manage several OAuth clients to do so without having to resort to a vetting process.
    We get the admin and the the admin can take it from there.
</p>
<p>The two specifications that are behind this are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>
    and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592">RFC 7592</a>. The flow is that you register an
    administrative client. This is initially not approved and any operation you try will fail
    with a message to that effect. We get an notification and once the admin client is approved,
    it may be used.</p>
