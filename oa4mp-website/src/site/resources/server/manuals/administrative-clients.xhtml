<h1>Administrative Clients</h1>
<p>An administrative client in OA4MP is a client that is authorized to create standard clients. A standard
OAuth client (which gets tokens, etc.) Administrative clients can be requested via a specific endpoint,
usually <code>../oauth2/admin-client</code>. It should be stressed that administrative clients are
not part of any OAuth standard and are therefore outside the requirements for standard OAuth clients.</p>

<p>The most ocmmon use of an administrative client is the dynamic registration of standard clients. This
allows an institution to create customized clients each with their own configuration for open
    authorization. An example would be a <a href="https://www.cilogon.org/comanage">COManage instance</a>
    which could set up a specific client for use by every virtual organization it creates.
